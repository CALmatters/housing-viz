# housing-viz

Code and data for visualizations featured in an [article](https://calmatters.org/articles/homeless-in-california-what-the-data-reveals/) on homelessness in California.

Sources: the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/coc-homeless-populations-and-subpopulations-reports/) and the [California Department of Finance](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/).

The bar charts were made using [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/), and the budget and circle pack were built with [D3](https://d3js.org/). To view the D3 visualizations locally, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.
